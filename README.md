# Pentesting notes

This is all the pentesting notes I have been gathering througout my learning. They have been made in a way that by using Nvim and Neorg, it is easy to traverse and find commands when needed.

The notes cover:

- Active Directory
- Web App pentesting
- Enumeration techniques
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Wifi attacks
- Password and Cracking attacks
- Post exploitation enumeration
- Post exploitation persistence
- Tunneling and pivoting
